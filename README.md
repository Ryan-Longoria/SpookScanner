# SpookScanner
CodeQuantum Project

SpookScanner is a website that will take in a photo from a user and allow the user to either edit the photo with multiple editing options, or do a "SpookScan" which is a reverse search of the image. The SpookScan will search the web for similar photos. 

What doesn't work:
1. There is not a database for Sign-up and Log-in profiles, but the buttons do work.
2. We were able to get a program working to edit photos with python, but we were unable to implement that in a web GUI.
3. We were not able to make significant progress on the reverse search. 
4. When the user uploads a file, it is saved in session storage, but it is unable to print out (replace the Pumpkin image)
